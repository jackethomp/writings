abstract: "White identitarianism has long been the mobilizing force through which Whites have coalesced around radical movements such as the Alt-Right. Despite these strong effects through White identity, however, it is worth considering whether positive feelings towards the Alt-Right are similarly pervasive among minority populations, and whether these feelings are conditional on the same set of predictors for non-White individuals as they are for Whites. Using data from the 2016-2017 Voter Study, our pooled cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2016-2017 Voter Study indicates that levels of affect for the Alt-Right movement do not differ substantively across categories of racial identification. More importantly, our multilevel linear models using panel data indicate that affect for the Alt-Right is not conditional on the same set of predictors when contrasting on race. The findings highlight the important role of racial identity and group affect as predictors of minority support for White nationalist movements."

### Brief Overview:

Studies of the Alt-Right movement in the US, especially as it relates to identifying their demographic constituency has in the past been mostly limited to forming associations between the movement and White Identitarianism. Using an alternative dataset of American voter attitudes, we look beyond White Identity politics and examine the determinants of Minority-Ethnic support for the movement.
